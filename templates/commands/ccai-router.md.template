You are routing a task to the most suitable AI provider based on task characteristics and provider capabilities.

## Routing Strategy

Read the routing strategy from `~/.claude/ccai/routing.md` for detailed rules and preferences.

## Routing Steps

**Step 1: Analyze Task**

Analyze the user's task to determine:
- Task type (web-scraping, code-generation, data-processing, etc.)
- Estimated complexity
- Tool usage intensity
- Expected duration

**Step 2: Select Providers**

Based on the task analysis and routing strategy, select 1-3 suitable providers from the available options above.

Filter out disabled providers (where `disabled: true`).

**Step 3: (Optional) Get Execution Plans**

For complex tasks, you may request execution plans from multiple providers:

```bash
for provider in provider1 provider2; do
  echo "Getting plan from $provider..."
  ccai merge-prompts --provider $provider --plan-only > /tmp/prompt-$provider.md
  claude --settings "$(ccai merge-settings $provider)" \
    --system-prompt "/tmp/prompt-$provider.md)" \
    -p "Analyze this task and provide an execution plan with cost estimation: /tmp/task.md)"
done
```

Compare the plans and select the best one.

**Step 4: Execute Selected Provider**

Use the selected provider's command:

```bash
/ccai-{selected_provider} "$ARGUMENTS"
```
